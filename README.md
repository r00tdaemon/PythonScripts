# PythonScripts
My python scripts. Results of my laziness  
I don't know if any of these will be useful for anyone because they are mostly the scripts which I made just for myself.

### Ask
Script to fetch and save all your unanswered questions from ask.fm in a text file.  
Don't ask why I needed it

### Auto-Login
Script which logs me in VIT wifi. Schedule it with cron or task scheduler.  
The password(s) are stored in password.txt in format - `username::password`

### BrowserState
Saves my opened tabs in browser in a text file. Useful when my firefox crashes or windows has to restart for updates.  
Also useful when you have multiple tabs opened for something but would like to continue with it later.

### CodingNinjas
Script to save all the assignment questions with your answers from codingninjas.in 

### Change-mac
Script to spoof mac address. You can set to a mac of your own choice or set it randomly. Uses argparse, you need to provide the interface with every option.
